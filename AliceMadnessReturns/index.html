            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>The events of Alice: Madness Returns begin where the previous game American McGee's Alice left off: desperately struggling with her own mind, <br>
                Alice is now in an establishment for children with psychological problems, and memories of her whole family dying in the fire haunt her.<br>
                Now another threat - which appears as a giant train - seeks to destroy her Wonderland. <br>
                Alice will battle through stages to stop the train and find out its true meaning.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Alice: Madness Returns isn't a perfect game, but like Alice herself, once drawn into Wonderland you may find yourself staying there for awhile, all the time being fascinated by its beauty and its hideousness.<br> 
                That said; if the concept doesn't excite you, then you may want to stay out of this rabbit hole."
