        <p>Bagel Ideas refers to the ideas cooked up by various members on their journey to Bagels. Bagels is an event that occurs whenever someone stays up until five AM (often for school or some other deadline, but also in celebration) and decides that a fresh bagel is exactly what they need before collapsing for bed. Thus begins the journey to Bagels, which varies in definition from the twenty minutes to get to Bagel Land, to the hours it takes to stay awake.</p>
