            <h2>BeeGame</h2>
            <p>A barebones set up of a bee-based dating game. This project was created independantly as part of Wichack, a 24-hour hackathon. BeeGame is an educational dating game with the goal of encouraging people to learn about the various native (and invasive) bees of North America. Adding a base-building aspect to the standard dating game format, you'll have to choose not only the correct option to charm the various bees, but tend to your garden and provide the habitat the various bees prefer. </p>

            <h2>Music Generator</h2>
            <p>So I know that we're not supposed to use bootstrap but I really like the idea of slides here so I'm going to try and program it without using bootstrap. I really shouldn't be since I've got other equally pressing and as of right now more demanding projects for other classes but I really want slides so I'm doing it anyway! Ipsum eum natus fugiat aut!

            <p>Ideally I want to change "New Projects" to "Projects" and have a separate webpage with the projects separated into complete, hackathon, and projects in progress. It gives some context to why some have so few commits. Ipsum eum natus fugiat aut!

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a Game Developer and Computer Programmer from just about everywhere in Colorado. I started learning to code in sixth grade (when I was allowed to buy my first video game) and haven't left either alone since. I was lucky enough to be able to teach and tutor kids in Unity over the summer and be the same positive influence in programming that my teachers were to me at that age.<br><br>As a current student of RIT I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree in both Game Design and Development and Computer Science. I've really enjoyed the opportunity to expand my skills out into all the fields that go into making a game, from project management and programming to animation. <br><br>Outside of class I'm an active member of Computer Science House, and love to go to the various seminars and events happening every night. CSH has been a huge part of my experience at RIT and they've really encouraged me to branch out past class assignments and to pursue my own interests and projects. I'll always be grateful that I'm able to immediately reach out to a community that can tell me exactly why I'll need a stronger motor than a hex bug's to get a furby to walk.</p>

                <p>I would really love to expand on this one it's my pet project right now but I haven't had much time to work on it so it's nothing stellar yet. Ipsum eum natus fugiat aut!

                <h3>Starfall</h3>
                <p>This one was a class project and is now the reason why I don't have any Git commits over the summer. I really love the idea I've got for this game's combat system and put any spare time I had this summer into getting the basics of this working so I can have a demo! Ipsum eum natus fugiat aut!
