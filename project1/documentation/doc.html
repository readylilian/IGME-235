        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>This portfolio was made to showcase my projects in a more clean and descriptive way than a simple GitHub link, with the added benefit of showing off what I can do with HTML5 and CSS. Though I was unable to add in the Javascript I wanted to, it still looks clean and I'm pleased with how it turned out. In the future I'd like to make a more in-depth landing page for each project to really display what went into each project. Because of this I organized my projects with those that I am not actively working on and are in some complete stage at the top, with information about me followed by current projects and how to contact me. With the focus being on recruiters my resume is easy to access and the first avaliable item on the page.
