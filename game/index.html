        <h3>Description</h3>
    
        <p>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to 
        dig your way through the earth.<br> Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, 
        called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. <br>
        The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the 
        monsters to the point where they explode. [...]<br></p>
