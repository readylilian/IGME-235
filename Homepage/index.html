        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a second year here at RIT, majoring in both Game Design and Development, and Computer Science.<br>
            I'm really enjoying IGME-235 so far, turns out making websites is pretty simple and really fun!
            It's really satifying to make a change to something and see it reflected immediately.<br>
            I'm hoping to learn some of the more complex aspects of websites, so that I can make my own portfolio clean and professional.
            I figure that having a website showing off what you can do that you made yourself serves as pretty solid evidence that you can handle yourself.
        </p>
